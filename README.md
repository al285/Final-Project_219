Project 2

For your final project, you are to create three graphs using D3 (http://d3js.org/) that use data from IPEDS to answer 3 questions about colleges.  You can use this chart library that is based on D3 too: http://c3js.org/ or find / write your own. 

1.	A bar graph showing the top 10 colleges by enrollment.   
2.	A pie graph that shows the gender distribution of a college that you select
3.	A line graph that shows the change in tuition over 3 years for a college that you select.

Your project should be based on project 1, so you will need to modify project 1 to import additional data from the IPEDS data files.
